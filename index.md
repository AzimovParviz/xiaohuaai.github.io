I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn since October 2017. My mentor is Prof. Don Zagier.

I did my Ph.D in [Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu](https://www.imj-prg.fr)/[Sorbonne Université](http://www.sorbonne-universites.fr) in Paris, under the supervision of [Prof. Jan Nekovar](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~jan.nekovar/).

My research interests lie in number theory and arithmetic geometry. Particularly, I am interested in special values of L-functions. Recently, I am working on generalization of multiple zeta values for arbitrary number fields, with focus on modular and geometric properties and their relation to mixed motives.
